# Unit Testing

For testing, the gpio level function was used. Unit testing was performed by manually performing an adjustment to the gpio pin and calling the function to ensure that the gpio status was reported to be the correct level. This proves that the function is capable of running and is performing as intended. This test could have also been done with a low gpio pin as well, however, the test is done to show the base function is working and, since it is intended to run as a task, it is not designed to end and cannot be tested with multiple criteria at once. The function could be adjusted to suit however, the function should be tested exactly as it would be used in the final product.

# Branching
In order to produce the adaptations for each question, a new branch was created to house the respective revision for the scenario presented. These are appropriately labeled for the specific question.
