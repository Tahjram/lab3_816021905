# Verification Testing

In this testing phase the final system procedures are setup and tested. The system is setup to perform round robin scheduling and, based on the output file, was successful since it showed a clear pattern to operation with no clear priority among tasks. This test sought out to verify that the gpio task was performing as intended and to ensure that the system was able to properly perform round robin scheduling where the gpio pin was constantly turned on and off with the gpio status being reported.
